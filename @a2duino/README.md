# a2duino

a2duino is a catchy name for my Arduino based data acquisition system for use with the PLDAPS package.  There are two main components:  an Arduino sketch and a MATLAB handle class creating an object.  The MATLAB object handles serial communication with the Arduino and allows control of the main functions of the DAQ.

The file java.opts should go inthe folder from which you launch MATLAB, for example  
/usr/local/MATLAB/R2015b/bin/glnxa64
