# a2duino

a2duino is a catchy name for my Arduino based data acquisition system for use with the PLDAPS package.  There are two main components:  an Arduino sketch and a MATLAB handle class creating an object.  The MATLAB object handles serial communication with the Arduino and allows control of the main functions of the DAQ.
